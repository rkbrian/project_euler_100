 *  alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical
 *  position in the list to obtain a name score.
 *  For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which
 *  is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.
 *  So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
 *  What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
 * Return: 0 if success, 1 if fail
