-- Prologue --
My mother is a Sudoku zealot, she buys tons of Sudoku puzzle books to play.
As a birthday gift to her, I made this program that can generate Sudoku puzzles.
(And to save her money on buying those books! ðŸ˜¡)
This is a hack project based on the following link:
    Sudoku Generator Algorithm - www.101computing.net/sudoku-generator-algorithm/

-- Progress --
The original code on this site generates a random Sudoku puzzle, but I want more!
I want to control it with inputs for the following parameters:
    1. Diffculty (Easy-Medium-Hard-Expert, done)
    2. Layout preference (No_preference-Symmetrical-Axial, done)
    3. Expert level: No hint of a certain number (e.g. all given numbers in the grid
        does not include "1", not started yet)
