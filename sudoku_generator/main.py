-- Prologue --
My mother is a Sudoku zealot, she buys tons of Sudoku puzzle books to play.
I made this program that can generate Sudoku puzzles, which I plan to give to her
as a birthday gift. (And this should save her money from buying more books! ðŸ˜¡)
I didn't invent the wheel, it is a hack project based on the following link:
    Sudoku Generator Algorithm - www.101computing.net/sudoku-generator-algorithm/

-- Develop Progress --
The original code was very basic, it generates a random Sudoku puzzle, but I wanted more!
I wanted to add controls with inputs for the following parameters:
    1. Diffculty (Easy / Medium / Hard / Expert) ---- done
    2. Layout preference (No preference / Symmetrical / Axial) ---- done
    3. Expert level: one certain number is not hinted (e.g. all given numbers in the grid
        does not include "7") ---- done

-- Features --
1. Selectable difficulty (4 choices)
2. Selectable preference of the given number layout
    (no preference / random, symmetrical layout, axial layout)
3. Expert level difficulty: the clue numbers are not all 9 types, it is missing one type
4. Generating a solution / answer grid is optional, before generating the puzzle
    (answer would be shown for 10 seconds, then turn into puzzle grid)
5. Python-Turtle window drawing the grid and the numbers

-- Outcome --
Total hours of developing: 10
I'm very satisfied! Score 10/10 to myself!
Issues: needs an automatic method to save the puzzle or the answer grid images, right now
    the user has to take screenshots. Pylance hates Image or Imagegrab imports
