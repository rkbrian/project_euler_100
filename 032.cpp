/**
 * main - We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use
 *  of all the digits 1 to n exactly once;
 *  for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
 *  The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254,
 *  containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
 *  Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
 *  can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
 *  Hint: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only
 *  include it once in your sum.
 * Return: 0 if success, 1 if fail
