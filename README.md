## Overview
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.\
The current goals of this repository are to solve 100 coding questions and to build my portfolio üòÅ. The ultimate goal is to train my problem solving logics.\
All codes in this repository are workable and free of memory leak. The answers were proved correct by the website checkers.

## Challenge links
[**Introduction**](https://projecteuler.net/about)\
[**Problem archives**](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

## Running Environments
 - Linux
 - WSL

## How to Use This Repository
1. Go to the chanllenge archives website and pick a problem to solve.
2. Make a file with the name of the problem ID number, problem descriptions and personal notes are documented. Some large inputs are saved in txt files. Compiling methods are stored in *Makefile*.
3. Compile to create the solution execution file. Command: **make \<ID>**.
4. Run the file to print answer. Command: **./\<ID>**. Sometimes more arguments are required.
5. Type the answer in the problem webpage to check.

## Current Progress
18 of 100 questions are solved, no. 19 is on progress.

## Development Goals
1. All current solution files were written in C language. I plan to have up to 20 C files.
2. I plan to write more languages for self training of coding, including:
   - C++
   - Python
   - Javascript
3. I plan to solve the problems with skips as few as possible, because in my account I can receive a badge for doing this.
