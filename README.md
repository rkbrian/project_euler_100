## Overview
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.\
The current goals of this repository are to solve 100 coding questions and to build my portfolio üòÅ. The ultimate goal is to train my problem solving logics.\
All codes in this repository are workable and free of memory leak. The answers were proved correct by the website checkers.\
**Warning**: This repository is a personal challege project, it is for learning purposes and technical communications only. Viewers are not allowed to copy this repository's file contents for their own answers of the Project Euler challenges, which is considered cheating.

[**Problem archives**](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

## Running Environments
 - Linux
 - WSL

## How to Use This Repository
1. Create an account on the Project Euler website for work submission and records.
2. Go to the chanllenge archives website and pick a problem to solve.
3. In this repository, make a file with the name of the problem ID number, the problem descriptions and personal notes are documented. Some large inputs are saved in txt files. Compiling methods are stored in *Makefile*.
4. Compile to create the solution execution file. Command: **make \<ID>**.
5. Run the file to print the answer. Command: **./\<ID>**. Sometimes more arguments are required (see the notes in *Makefile*).
6. Type the answer in the problem webpage to check.

## Current Progress
18 of 100 questions are solved, no. 19 is on progress.

## Development Goals
1. All current solution files were written in C language. I plan to have up to 20 C files.
2. I plan to write more languages for self training of coding, including:
   - C++
   - Python
   - Javascript
3. I plan to solve the problems with skips as few as possible, because in my Project Euler account I can receive a badge for continuous works.
