## Overview
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.\
The current goal of this repository is to solve 100 coding questions, and to build my portfolio üòÅ. The ultimate goal is to train my problem solving logics.\
All codes are workable and gives correct answers.
